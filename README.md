# iOS .strings Multi-file Editor (Vue 3 + TypeScript + Pinia)

## Overview
This webapp lets you upload, view, and edit multiple iOS .strings files (multi-language) side-by-side. You can edit all string values, paste translations, and export the files back. If all files have the same value for a key, only one row is shown. Robust handling for missing/empty fields. No search/filter logic.

## Features
- Upload multiple iOS .strings files (same keys/structure)
- View and edit all string values side-by-side
- Collapse/expand grouped keys (if any)
- Paste per-field for multi-language input (e.g. from Google Sheet)
- Export all files after editing
- Handles undefined/empty fields gracefully

## How to use
1. Upload multiple .strings files (e.g. en.strings, th.strings)
2. Click Ready to view and edit all keys/values side-by-side
3. Edit values directly, or use Paste to fill multiple languages at once
4. Export all files when done

# iOS .strings Multi-file Editor

A modern webapp for editing multiple iOS .strings files side-by-side, with advanced features for translation, review, and export.

## How to Use

1. **Choose Files:** Select multiple iOS .strings files (one per language, same keys).
2. **Ready:** Click **Ready** to load and edit all keys/values side-by-side.
3. **View:** Use **See All**/**Paging** to switch key views. Use **Search** to filter. Drag column headers to re-order languages.
4. **Edit:** Edit values directly or use **Paste** per row for quick input.
5. **Export:** Use floating buttons to export all, changed, or keep order.
6. **Back:** Use the floating **Back** button to restart (confirmation required).

### Highlight Legend
- ðŸŸ© **Edited (green):** This row has been changed from the original value.
- ðŸŸ¨ **Duplicate (yellow):** This row has duplicate values across languages.
- ðŸŸ¥ **All-equal (light red):** All values in this row are identical.

### Tips
- All processing is local. No files are uploaded to a server.
- The key column scrolls if long. Use the same keys in all files for best results.
- You can add new keys and values for all languages using the form above the table.
- You can re-order language columns by dragging the column headers.
